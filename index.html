						The Experience
					</h1>
					<p>
				When I heard that we were going on a field trip to ArcherMalmo, I was very excited mainly because I would be seeing dogs. When we arrived at the building the office setting was very open. I really liked that idea because it created a positive working environment to show the value of collaboration and team work. I also got to learn the day to day work habits of the programmers and designers. With that being said, my experience at ArcherMalmo was eye opening.

					<h1>Favorite Parts</h1>
				<p>
					My favorite part about this field trip was getting to learn more about what goes on in a web development agency. I loved getting to walk around and see all the floors, that are all very different, but they all come together to make the customer happy and in the end a great final product. I really enjoyed seeing the Palm Beach website, as a teenage girl who tans there, I really appreciated the website you all designed! I give it two thumbs up! Okay, I also really liked seeing all the dogs running around when we first got there, I mean who wouldn't?

					<h1>Career Path?</h1>
					<p>
					 This is my first year in a web designing class. Though the coding part is not my favorite, I love the creative side. I was very excited to come on this field trip to get a feel for this type of profession. As I was listening to the presentation I was getting more and more interested in the various aspects of this field. I love how this is a growing industry where there is alway something to learn.
